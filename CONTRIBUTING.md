# Contributing to Hatchet

Thanks for considering contributing to Hatchet. Hatchet is still a very early tool, and so the development process might be rather difficult until we've built some better tooling. If you're willing to put up with some back-and-forth on Github or [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZMeUafwH89), then welcome! We'll be as responsive as possible.

If you encounter any issues while getting set up, there are two options:

1. File a bug report using Github issues, and we'll help you get set up
2. Fix it and open a PR

> **IMPORTANT:** If you've found a security issue, please email [alexander [at] hatchet [dot] run](mailto:alexander@hatchet.run) instead of raising a public issue.
